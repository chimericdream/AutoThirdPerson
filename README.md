Auto Third Person
=================

Tiny Minecraft mod. Automatically enter third person mode when you fly an elytra or ride a minecart, boat, or animal, and automatically leave the mode again when you stop.

As a bonus, there's also an option to disable "first person flipped" mode, so F5 just toggles between first person and behind-player camera. For that Minecraft Beta feel, I guess.
